# 📰 Sport News Project

**Sport News** is a styled news website focused on sports content — built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  
This is another step in my web‑development journey, practising layout, content organisation and UI design.

## 🧠 About the Project  
In the Sport News project I designed a clean news‑style layout for sports articles and stories.  
The goal was to present an intuitive navigation and visually appealing presentation of news content, while using a consistent theme and responsive design.

I created it to practice:  
- Structuring multiple sections/pages of content (e.g., headline, articles, sidebar)  
- Designing a layout that works well on both desktop and mobile  
- Styling a “news site” UI using CSS (cards, grid or flex layout, typography)  
- Applying basic interactivity or dynamic behaviour via JavaScript (if included)  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **HTML5** – semantic markup for sections, articles, nav  
- **CSS3** – styling, layout (grid/flex), media queries for responsiveness  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – for any interactive features (e.g., filtering, dynamic loading)  

---

## ✨ Features  
- News‑style site layout with articles (headline + summary)  
- Clean typographic styling and spacing for readability  
- Responsive design suitable for mobile & desktop  
- Stylish card or grid presentation of articles  
- Easy to extend for more content or dynamic updates

## 💡 What I Learned  
- How to design a multi‑section website (navigation, main content, sidebar/footer)  
- How to make a layout responsive using CSS media queries and flexible units  
- How to present structured content (articles/news items) in a clean and professional way  
- How to take a design idea and execute it with only HTML/CSS/JS
